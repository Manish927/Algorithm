/*
   Write a function that takes in a list of unique strings and returns a list of semordnilap pairs. A semordnilap pair is defined as a set of different
   strings where the reverse of one word is the same as the forward version of the other. For example, the words "diaper" and "repaid" are a semordnilap pair,
   as the words "palindromes" and "semordnilap".

   The order of the returned pairs and the order of the string within each pair do not matter.

   Sample input:
   words = ["diaper", "abc", "test", "cba", "repaid"]
   sample output
   [["diaper, "repaid"], ["abc", "cba"]]
